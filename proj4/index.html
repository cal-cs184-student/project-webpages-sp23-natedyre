	<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
	<p>In this project we built a physically based, real time cloth simulation, using a mass and spring based
		system. We first had to fill in our data structure that represents our cloth. Next we implemented the actual
		simulation, to do this we had to figure out all the forces acting on the cloth at each time step and adjust
		the positions accordingly. After our cloth could move, we could make it interact in its environment by handling collisions
		with spheres, planes, and itself. The last part was writing some GLSL shader programs, which allowed us to
		harness the power of the GPU in order to make interesting textures for our cloth.
	</p>

	<h2 align="middle">Part I: Masses and springs</h2>
	<p>
		Given a height, width, and the number of points along each axis, we built a grid of evenly spaced
		point masses, with the top most left point mass at position (0, 0) and the bottom right at position
		(width, height). If the grid's orientation is horizontal we build the grid
		on the xz plane and set the y coordinate to 0. If the grid's orientation is vertical we build the grid on the
		xy plane while varying the z position by a random number between -1/1000 and 1/1000.
		We also set all the point masses that had positions in the pinned vector to be pinned,
		so they wouldn't move in simulation. The next step was to connect our point masses with springs with 3 different
		constraints, structural, shearing, and bending, and following the rules of each constraints.
	</p>

	<h2 align="middle">Part 2: Simulation via numerical integration</h2>
	<p>
		For the simulation we have to take into account external forces, and spring correction forces.
		For external forces we simply loop through the external_accelerations array, sum all the vectors into
		a single vector, and then simply use F=ma to find the external force, we then apply this force to each point
		mass. To apply spring correction forces, we loop through each spring but only take into account a spring if
		the spring's constraint is enabled. We compute the magnitude of the force using Hooke's law as written out in
		the spec, scaling it by 0.2 if the spring constraint is bending. Then the force vector has the magnitude we
		just calculated with direction from one point mass to the other. We apply this force vector to one point
		mass and the opposite of this force vector to the other. The next step is to update the positions of the
		point masses according to the forces we accumulated in the last step using Velvet integration, simply using
		the equation given in the spec. The last step is to constrain how much our spring stretches, if the spring length
		is greater than 10% of the resting length, then we subtract the length by the max length (1.1 * rest length). If
		both point masses are not pinned we apply this correction equally to each one, if one is pinned, we apply the whole
		correction to only the unpinned one.

	<p>
		The ks value determines our stiff the springs in our cloth are (higher ks means more stiff). So when we use a low
		ks value, the springs are very "loose" and bouncy, throughout the simulation there is a lot of movement, at resting
		there are more wrinkles, and the cloth stretches down more. In contrast, with a high ks value, there is less
		movement from the springs during the simulation. At resting state, the cloth is shorter since the springs stretch less.

	</div>
	<br>

	<p>
		Density has a similar but opposite effect to changing the ks value since a higher density for the same volume means the cloth
		is heavier, and thus the force applied on each spring is greater. At resting a low density is similar to a high ks
		value, and a high density is similar to a low ks value.

	<p>
		The damping controls the loss in energy in our simulation. At a value of 0, the cloth does not lose any energy,
		so in the simulation it keeps swinging back and forth without stopping. At values close to 1 or equal to 1, the only
		movement is a slow fall to the resting state, with minimal/no movement after.

	<h2 align="middle">Part 3: Handling collisions with other objects</h2>
	<p>
		In this part we must handle how our cloth behaves when it collides with other objects. To do this
		we must check at each time step if the cloth is inside the primitive, if it is we change the those point masses'
		position so that it lies on the primitive's surface. For spheres, we first compute the distance from the point mass
		to the origin (in our code we use distance squared, so we don't take a square root), then we see if this is less than
		or equal to the radius (squared) of the sphere, if so the point mass is inside, and we must change the position. To find
		the tangent point where the point would have intersected the sphere we just find the vector from the origin to the point,
		scale it by the radius (first normalize then multiply by radius), then add it to the origin. Now if we just set this
		tangent point to be the point masses' new position, the cloth will eventually slide off the sphere since we don't take into account friction.
		To account for friction we compute the correction vector between the last position of the point mass and the tangent point
		then we update the position to be the last position plus the correction vector scaled by 1 - friction.
	</p>

			</td>
		</tr>
	</div>
	<br>

	<p>
		Next we must handle collisions with planes. To find if the point mass has intersected the plane, we take find
		the magnitude of the projection of the vector from a point on the plane to the point mass, and the
		normal of the plane. If this value is negative the point mass has intersected the plane. To find the tangent we
		add the unit normal scaled by the -projection plus the surface offset to the point mass. Then we update the position
		as before, computing the correction vector between the last position and the tangent point, and updating the position
		to be the last position plus the correction vector scaled by friction.

	<br>

	<h2 align="middle">Part 4: Handling self-collisions</h2>
	<p>
		The naive way of handling self-collisions would be to loop through all the point masses, and apply some correction
		force if they are within a certain distance of each other. Instead we create a hash map that uniquely maps a float
		to a 3D box volume in the scene. Then we can map each point mass to one of these boxes, and when checking for
		self-collisions for a given point masses, we can just check all the point masses besides itself in its own box.
		First we divide our 3d space into boxes with dimensions according to the spec, then for a given point mass,
		we divide its position by these coordinates, and apply the floor operator to obtain new coordinates. To map to a float,
		we took a linear combination of these new coordinates and the number of point masses along the width and height of the
		cloth. Next, we built our map using this hash function. Finally for each point mass, we check if the distance between
		it and other point masses in its box volume is within 2 * thickness. If it is we compute the correction vector with
		direction from the candidate to the point mass, and the length is however much is left for the distance to be 2 * thickness.

		When the cloth has high density or low ks value, the cloth makes many small folds with itself. When it has low

	<h2 align="middle">Part V: Shaders</h2>

	<p>
		<b>Shader Programs</b>
		<br><br>
		In order to speed up our raytracing computation, we can create shader programs that run in parallel on GPU. Shader programs
		take in inputs (attributes in vertex shaders) and output a 4D vector. For this project, we used two OpenGL shader types:
		vertex shaders and fragment shaders.
		<br><br>
		A vertex shader reads and writes all per-vertex values. In our .vert files we set "gl_position", which is the
		final screen-space location of this vertex. We also write "out" variables to communicate to the corresponding fragment shader.
		<br><br>
		The fragment shader writes all per-pixel (per-fragment) values. The fragment shader takes in the "out" variables from the vertex shader as input to
		compute a color that we write out to a 4D vector "out_color."
		<br><br>
		<b>Blinn-Phong</b>
		<br><br>
		To perform Blinn-Phong shading we combine ambient, diffuse, and specular shading. Ambient shading helps smooth out lighting
		by filling in dark shadows for parts that are facing away from the light. It just adds a constant color to account for disregarded
		illumination. Diffuse reflection produces a matte appearance using kd, a diffuse coefficient that determines the brightness. In our equation
		for diffuse shading, we also have a 1/r^2 falloff that accounts for decaying light intensity the further a surface is from a light source.
		Specular shading gives a shine depending on view direction. We calculate the half-angle direction (bisector) between the view angle and the light angle.
		We then use dot product of this bisector, h, and our normal instead of the light vector to get our cosine. The reason we use the max function against 0 for
		both diffuse and specular equations is because if it were the case that our cosine is negative, it would mean that our light is below the surface.

	<b>Bump and Displacement</b>
	<br><br>

	Bump mapping relies on the fragment shader to give the appearance of bumps on an object. Displacement mapping adds on to bump
	mapping by also modifying the positions of the vertices. We can see in the bump mapping image that sphere looks bumpy. However, the
	perimeter of the sphere is still perfectly round. In the displacement mapping image, the sphere obtains a more disfigured shape to
	account for the added bumpiness.

	<br><br>
	<b>Bump Shading 16 resolution vs 128 resolution</b>
	<br><br>
	When we change the mesh's coarseness in bump shading, we can see that the illusion of bumpiness starts to wear off. At height = 2 and
	height = 3, the sphere appears weird because the cloth is still physically very smooth making it seem like wallpaper.

	<br><br>
	<b>Displacement Shading 16 resolution vs 128 resolution</b>
	<br><br>
	As we increase coarseness with displacement shading the illusion is somewhat more withheld. Since the vertices within the
	cloth and the sphere are now geometrically moved, it helps keep up the illusion that the objects are actually bumpy. However just like
	in bump mapping, if we increase the coarseness by too much it appears overexaggerated.
